This project is a language analyzer implemented in Java, designed to parse and analyze structures of a given language input. 
The analyzer performs lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis, allowing it to identify and validate the structure of statements, keywords, operators, and other elements according to predefined grammar rules. 
Additionally, it generates an assembly language file as output, translating parsed statements into low-level code.
